# shot-in-es6
![][travis-url]

A bunch of testcases here to demonstrate how cool es6 is.

Because both [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and browsers are not widely support all the features for es6, we choose [babel](http://babeljs.io/) as the `transpiler` to make all the features work.

### Prerequisites ###
